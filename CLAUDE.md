# Project context — Finance

Android mobile app for personal finance. Offline-first, with all data stored
locally on the phone. Replaces and improves on Monefy.

Claude Code reads this file automatically when the project is opened.
Keep it up to date whenever we make new decisions.

## Language rule

- **The repository is English.** Code, comments, identifiers, documentation,
  commit messages, branch names and file names: all in English. The only
  exception is data coming from the real Monefy backup (account and category
  names such as `Tarjeta credito rappi` or `Ahorros`), which stays verbatim so
  the importer keeps working.
- **The conversation with Jose is in Spanish**, with simple, easy-to-follow
  explanations. English technical terms inside that Spanish are fine.
- **The app itself is multilingual** (Spanish by default, English available).
  Its own words live in `src/app/core/i18n/translations.ts` under English keys;
  no user-facing string belongs in a template or a component. What is NOT
  translated: the user's data (account names, category names, notes on a
  movement), the Monefy importer's pattern matching, and the Colombian tax
  module. Decision by Jose, 2026-09-09.

## About the user

- Jose, full-stack developer. Strong in .NET, Angular, TypeScript, SQL, Azure.
- New to: Ionic, Capacitor, mobile SQLite, Git/GitHub for personal projects.
- Lives in Colombia. Income in COP. Also holds USD accounts.
- Explanations: simple and clear, even in deep technical analysis.
- Before recommending anything, verify it against the real code or data.
  Explicitly mark what is assumed and what is verified.
- Before applying a change, assess the risk of breaking what already works.

## The real goal of the app

It is not just expense tracking. The underlying goal is **tax predictability**:
knowing, all year long, how much income tax will be owed, and therefore how
much to save each month so it can be paid with money already set aside, with
no surprises.

Everything else (categories, accounts, charts) exists to feed that.

## Decisions already made

### Stack

| Piece | Choice |
|---|---|
| UI framework | Angular + Ionic |
| Native packaging | Capacitor |
| Database | Local SQLite (`@capacitor-community/sqlite`) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| IDE | VS Code |
| Android | Android Studio (only for the SDK, emulator and APK signing) |

.NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid was ruled out despite being a better fit for Jose's
experience: as of today it has open Android issues (safe areas that leave the
UI unusable on .NET 10, startup crashes on the emulator). Not worth fighting
the framework on a long-running project.

### Non-negotiable business rules

1. **Offline-first.** The app never breaks without internet. If a network
   value is missing (FX rate, interest rate), the last cached value is used
   and flagged as such.

2. **Money as integers.** JavaScript has no decimal type; everything is
   float64. Amounts are stored as integers in minor units and only formatted
   for display. **Never add floats.** The Monefy backup already carries the
   typical garbage: `9421.2800000000007`.

   **Both COP and USD use 2 minor units (cents).** COP was originally going to
   be stored as whole pesos, but 2,313 of the 12,890 backup rows carry cents
   (including opening balances such as `66,750,767.94`), and rounding them
   would make balances impossible to reconcile against the bank. COP is also
   *displayed* with 2 decimals, the same way Monefy does it. Decision by Jose,
   2026-09-08.

3. **Multi-currency with a per-transaction rate.** Every foreign-currency
   transaction stores the rate that bank actually applied to that transaction,
   as an editable value. History is never recalculated when the official rate
   changes. The official TRM (Superfinanciera, public API on datos.gov.co) is
   the anchor; the bank rate is derived or typed in.

4. **Credit cards as liabilities.** The balance represents the debt (negative
   or zero). The credit limit is a separate attribute. Available credit is
   computed: credit limit − debt. They do not count as an asset for net worth,
   but they do subtract as a liability. Monefy modeled them wrong (a positive
   initial balance of 800,000 = the credit limit, mixing two concepts).

5. **Accounts can be flagged as "excluded from net worth"**, same as Monefy.

6. **Interest and cashback live separately.** They are not mixed into the
   balance of the account that produced them. Their own module, because their
   tax treatment is different.

7. **Everything editable.** Any value the app computes or fetches from the
   internet must be overridable by hand. The app also stores both: the
   computed value and the manually entered one, so they can be compared.

8. **Configurable DIAN forms.** The tax module must not hardcode form 210.
   Each form is a configurable set of rules and line items, so others can be
   added later.

9. **An account can hold several currencies.** Global66 holds COP and USD, ARQ
   holds USD and EUR, and more will follow. Each currency is its own row in
   `accounts`; an `account_groups` row ties them into the one account the user
   actually has. Single-currency accounts leave `group_id` null. Converting
   between two currencies of the same account is an ordinary transfer between
   its rows, which captures the rate the provider applied. Decision by Jose,
   2026-09-08.

10. **Icons are user-supplied, not just a fixed catalog.** Accounts and
   categories can use either a built-in icon or an image the user provides
   (a real bank logo, for instance). Custom images are stored inside the
   database itself, so a backup stays a single file. Decision by Jose,
   2026-09-08.

11. **A credit limit is history, not a movement.** Changing a limit - up or
   down - moves no money and leaves the debt untouched; only the room left
   over changes. So limits live in `credit_limit_changes` (one row per card
   per day, holding the limit as of that day) and never in the ledger. That is
   the mistake Monefy forced: with nowhere to put a limit increase, it was
   logged as a deposit, which understated the debt by exactly the increase.
   `accounts.credit_limit_minor` stays the limit in force today, kept in step
   by the repository. The import seeds the history from the backup but never
   overrules a confirmed or hand-corrected limit. Decision by Jose, 2026-09-09.

12. **Manual edits win over re-imports.** The Monefy CSV is re-exported
   regularly, carrying the whole history again plus new rows, so the importer
   must be repeatable. Any record edited by hand inside Finance is flagged
   `locked` and a later re-import never overwrites it: a manual edit means Jose
   corrected it towards the final, true version. Decision by Jose, 2026-09-08.

### Real limits that must not be promised away

- **The rate a given bank applied on a given day is not available online.**
  There is no public or historical source. Only the official daily TRM exists.
- **Per-bank interest rates are not reliably available either.** They live in
  terms and conditions that change without notice. The solution is a per-account
  rate history (effective annual rate with valid-from/valid-to) maintained by
  the user, with the app accruing day by day.
- **Do not use an LLM to fetch exact figures** (TRM, interest rates). It makes
  numbers up. For numeric data, use deterministic APIs with a local cache. An
  LLM does fit for auto-classifying categories or reading a bank statement.

## Current status

Phase 1 in progress. The SQLite schema, the migration runner, the money
helpers and the repository layer are written and covered by 114 tests that run
against a real SQLite engine with no dependencies:

```
node tools/db/run-tests.mjs
```

Phase 3 has started. The Angular/Ionic project now exists around the database
layer: Angular 22, Ionic 9, Capacitor 8, standalone components.

```
npm start          ionic serve, in the browser
npm run db:test    the 114 database tests
npm run db:import  import the newest export into build/finance.db
```

Three screens so far — accounts with balances, the month view of movements, and
the CSV import. The importer runs in the app itself, which is how the history
gets onto the phone, where there is no command line.

**Not yet verified: SQLite in the browser.** The web build needs `jeep-sqlite`
to mount and `initWebStore()` to succeed, and that only happens at runtime.
Everything up to it — build, types, plugin API — is confirmed.

## Pending from Jose

- Node 26.1.0 installed (shared with the client's Angular projects). It is
  outside the range Angular declares (^20.19 || ^22.12 || ^24), but it works
  with a warning. DO NOT replace it: it would break the work environment. If
  the toolchain fails because of the version, install fnm and isolate per
  project with `.node-version`.

- [x] `Plata` is COP only, ungrouped. New in the 2026-09-08 export.
- [x] eToro, XTB and Plenti hold USD only. Balances on 2026-09-08:
      eToro 17,195.31, XTB 2,607, Plenti 0.
- [ ] Current balance of each currency of the two multi-currency accounts:
      ARQ (USD and EUR) and Global66 (COP and USD). The last ones needed to
      reconcile the import (see `docs/01-monefy-backup-analysis.md`).
- Deferred, not pending: market value of the brokers. eToro and XTB move with
  the market daily, so their balance is not derivable from transactions and is
  not something the ledger should be reconciled against. The app records their
  exact movements only, and the balance it shows for them is what was put in,
  not what they are worth. Valuation and its tax treatment come later; interest
  and a change in market value are taxed differently in Colombia and must not
  share a table just because they look alike. Decision by Jose, 2026-09-08.
- [ ] Confirm whether he currently files form 210 and whether a legal entity
      is involved.

## Documents

- `docs/01-monefy-backup-analysis.md` — what the backup contains and its problems
- `docs/02-technical-decisions.md` — the reasoning behind each decision
- `docs/03-roadmap.md` — order of work by phase
- `docs/04-stack-guide.md` — stack primer for someone coming from .NET/Angular
- `docs/05-data-model.md` — the SQLite schema and the reasoning behind it
- `docs/06-schema.md` — the schema drawn: ER diagram, delete rules, constraints
- `data/monefy-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` — the real backups, one file per export.
  Never overwrite one: comparing consecutive exports is what verifies that
  Monefy orders rows stably, which the import fingerprint relies on.
